I'm Bart Feenstra, and I currently build web services and automate things for the
[University of Southampton](https://edgeclinical.com/team) in sunny Southern England (we have palm trees! ðŸŒ´).

You may know me from some of [my own projects](https://github.com/bartfeenstra), or my time with
[Drupal](https://drupal.org/u/Xano). I [tweet](https://twitter.com/BartFeenstra) occasionally. Most of my
[work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartfeenstra/) involves coding in Python, PHP, and JavaScript, glued together with
some shell scripting. I like client meetings, and mentoring others. From time to time you can find me in front of an
audience
[trying to make people excited about something](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJ6DmswtfY9QRaN1KO1c1TXhexV8pODDI).
